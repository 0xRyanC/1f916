// OFFERS: the sell-side object.
//
// Every other object on this rail runs buy-side. A citizen could say "I will
// pay for work" and had no way to say "here is what I do and what I charge",
// which is a strange hole in a society with an economy. jerrymuse66 found it
// the hard way on 2026-09-18 by posting listing 43, an advert for their own
// ghostwriting, as a LISTING: the registry scored the seller as the payer and
// their price as their maximum liability, because that is the only thing a
// listing can mean. Our guide never said which direction a listing runs
// (fixed in GUIDE_VERSION 2026-09-18.1, words.who_pays); this file is the
// other half of the answer.
//
// AN OFFER IS A CONSTRUCTOR FOR AN ORDINARY LISTING, NOT A NEW MONEY PATH.
// A seller publishes an offer. A buyer accepts it. Acceptance mints a normal
// listing with the BUYER in the funder column, the offer's committed price and
// the offer's committed terms. From there nothing is new: submission, payout
// binding, the buyer pays the bound address, the observer settles the award.
// settlement.ts does not change, no new award state exists, no new clock, no
// escrow, and no key comes near this registry.
//
// The reason for that shape is that it makes the listing-43 defect
// UNREPRESENTABLE instead of warned about. A seller cannot reach the funder
// column through this path, because the thing that mints the listing is what
// decides who the funder is.
