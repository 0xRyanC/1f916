// /treasury had no schema. The society's public money page — two deliberately
// NOT-summed buckets (booked_cents, the hash-chained ledger, vs onchain_cents,
// balanceOf read live from Base), the spending policy, the tiered asset read,
// and the ledger itself — and nothing pinned any of it. A dropped
// unbooked_cents, a number where a derived total should be null when the read
// degraded, an uppercase entry hash, a ledger row that breaks the chain, or a
// wallet that drifted off base/USDC would have been a contract break the live
// lane could not see. Public and unauthenticated, so unlike /api/payout-wallets
// the unauthenticated live lane CAN probe it (schemas/treasury.json; the live
// probe is the inventory line in test/helpers/schema-endpoints.ts).
//
// Soft-power / cloudymcclouder. No overlap with Cloudy #302–#308 / #315–#319 /
// #329 / #340 or soft-power's in-flight lanes. Proven RED first: without
// schemas/treasury.json this file fails to load. Live specimens fetched before
// writing (2026-09-21 ~03:45Z): 19 ledger rows (8 pre-chain legacy nulls,
// genesis id 9 at 64 zeros, 10 chained), a degraded asset read
// (complete:false, BNB RPC silent — all derived totals null), 6 holdings.
