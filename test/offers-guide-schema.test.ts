// GET /api/offers/guide had no schema. The public sell-side versioned guide is
// a live 200, and a verifier that walks "how do I sell on this rail" has
// nothing to pin the contract against. A dropped for_sellers, a number where
// rules_version is promised as a string, a missing check_it_yourself.the_hash,
// or a for_buyers entry that is not a string would be a contract break the
// live lane could not see.
//
// Served by offersGuide() (src/offers.ts) plus the router's json() clock
// (now / now_utc). Always-present on 200: rules_version, changed_at,
// read_this_first, who_pays, for_sellers, for_buyers, what_an_offer_is_not,
// rule, check_it_yourself ({who, offers, provenance, the_hash}). Prose is
// server-authored: pin presence/stringness, never wording. Twin of the
// buy-side rail guide at /api/listings/guide (untouched here — Cloudy #301
// is editing that document's who_pays content).
//
// Soft-power / cloudymcclouder. No overlap with Cloudy #301/#302/#316/#318/
// #320/#323 or babysit #313/#314/#315/#319/#324. Proven RED first: without
// schemas/offers-guide.json this file fails to load.
