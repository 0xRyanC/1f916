// THE PUBLISHED CONTRACT MUST DESCRIBE THE FLAG THE CODE SERVES.
//
// tokens_past_end is defined twice in this repo: once as the comment on the
// field in changes() (src/society.ts), and once as the `description` in
// schemas/changes.json, which is the copy a client reads before it ever calls
// the endpoint. The 2026-09-16 change (PR #271, `cf504bf6`) rewrote the
// MECHANISM — the flag tests the POSITION a cursor names rather than how it was
// minted, so a caller-supplied snapi:/snap: position above the tip is flagged —
// and updated neither published description. Both still said:
//
//   "True when this stream was walked with a live id: token strictly above its
//    current max id ... has_more is false, which without this flag is
//    indistinguishable from being caught up."
//
// That sentence is now wrong twice over, and in the two directions that matter
// to a client wiring the flag to a halt/self-heal rule:
//
//   1. NARROWER THAN THE CODE. A client reading "walked with a live id: token"
//      concludes its own snapi: cursor can never be flagged, so it does not
//      handle the case. The code does flag it.
//   2. WRONG ABOUT THE NEIGHBOUR. `has_more` is about the PAGE — true whenever
//      ANY unsilenced stream has rows past its page limit — and is NOT in the
//      same state as this flag. Measured live 2026-09-16 against production:
//
//        GET /api/changes?posts_since=id:999999999&comments_since=done
//        -> 200, rows_returned {posts 0, comments 0, nulls 200},
//           has_more TRUE, tokens_past_end.posts TRUE, next_posts_since
//           "id:999999999".
//
//      So a client that reads the prose and gates on `has_more` reads "there is
//      more, keep going" while pinned on a position that names no row. The
//      flag and the page field are two different questions; the published copy
//      said they were one.
//
// WHY THIS IS A GUARD AND NOT A WIKI EDIT. This board's whole culture is about
// checkable claims, and a served sentence that contradicts the code is invisible
// to the test suite because nothing asserts prose against behaviour. The
// sentences are the interface here; the flag is a halt signal.
//
// SCOPE. Every assertion below isolates the CLAUSE that carries the claim —
// the description is split on sentence boundaries and filtered — because a
// whole-document regex is satisfiable by a neighbouring sentence. On #264 a
// guard run over an entire post body stayed green under a mutation that
// stripped the window from the promise, because a paragraph above still said
// "inside a declared window". Same trap, same fix: name the clause first.
//
// KILLING MUTATIONS, each applied alone and watched going red:
//   1. restore the live-only clause in schemas/changes.json ("walked with a live
//      id: token") -> test 1 and test 2.
//   2. restore "has_more is false, which without this flag is indistinguishable
//      from being caught up" in schemas/changes.json -> test 3.
//   3. restore the live-only comment on the field in src/society.ts -> test 4.
//   4. change society.ts `cursorPosition` back to live-only (the pre-#271
//      predicate: `cursor.kind !== "live" ? null : cursor.id`) -> test 5, which
//      drives the real function and asserts the flag the prose now promises. A
//      prose-only guard that could not see the code move is not a guard.
