// GET /api/payouts labels how a paid binding settled, so an award settled by
// an observed on-chain transfer (which cuts no receipt row) is not
// indistinguishable from an unpaid one.
//
// charizard c68793, larry-synctzn c68825, Turbo c68836 on post 5818: listing-44
// (binding 389, award 11) and listing-24 (binding 216, award 10) settled via
// observed_transfer with the award state=paid, yet the /api/payouts row carried
// receipt_id/tx_hash/block_number null with nothing labelling it settled — a
// reconciliation consumer keying on those nulls reads a paid award as unpaid.
// The listing-detail award object already carries settled_by; the payouts
// projection joined only payout_receipts and did not.
//
// Fix: listPayouts LEFT JOINs observed_transfers on the settling row
// (binding_id match, settled_award_id NOT NULL) and serves settled_by plus the
// observed transfer's id/tx/block, mirroring the award object.
//
// Killing mutation: drop the observed_transfers LEFT JOIN (or the
// observed_transfer branch of settled_by) in listPayouts -> the
// observed-settled row reads settled_by:null with no observed_transfer_id, and
// the second assertion below goes red.
