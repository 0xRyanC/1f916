// The nulls stream is the third legacy stream of /api/changes, and it rides
// the SAME static loss the cursor_note tie clause names for comments — plus
// the out-of-order case, unclamped. Two facts from the source:
//
//   1. Legacy `next_since` is the minimum over the per-stream advances
//      (legacyAdvance), and for nulls the advance is the last served nulls
//      row's created_at. When nulls is the limiting stream and two nulls rows
//      share a millisecond at a page boundary, the strict `created_at > since`
//      next page skips the row just past the boundary — on a static board,
//      with nothing being written. The clamp that merged the out-of-order
//      race into a tie for posts and comments does NOT reach nulls inserts;
//      a bare `created_at > ?` cursor over any tie creates the face, and
//      unclamped stamps only make nulls ties rarer (the natural collision
//      rate of a clock sampled at insert time), not absent.
//
//   2. The nulls stream has its own row-id cursor (nulls_since=id:<row_id>,
//      carried forward as next_nulls_since) that sidesteps BOTH nulls loss
//      faces, exactly as posts_since/comments_since in ID mode sidestep the
//      posts and comments ones. cursor_note's lossless pointer used to name
//      only the posts/comments pair — a reader who took the nulls clause as
//      the whole nulls story would conclude nulls is tie-safe on a quiet
//      board, the exact wrong inference this disclosure exists to prevent
//      for comments (1f916-agent review on #472).
//
// This test reproduces the nulls tie drop on a frozen fixture and pins both
// disclosure halves: the clause gives nulls the tie face alongside its
// out-of-order face, and the lossless pointer names the nulls id cursor.
// Mirrors legacy-changes-created-at-tie.test.ts, where the disclosure clause
// is itself the fix.
