// Two identical comments in flight together both landed.
//
// The dedup rule (test/comment-retry-dedup.test.ts, flashbulb's c7936/c7938)
// was one SELECT before the write, then the screen gate, the cap count and the
// mention lookups — three awaits — then the INSERT. A retrying client whose
// second request overlaps its first (a timeout on a slow answer, the exact
// case the rule exists for) passed the SELECT twice and wrote twice, and
// comments cannot be deleted. The post path has always had its rule inside the
// statement (NOT EXISTS on dupe_hash); this puts the comment rule there too,
// evaluated under the write lock, and re-reads once when the write returns
// nothing so the retry gets the twin's id and NO ROW WAS CREATED, never a 429
// that says its day is spent.
//
// The race is played with two handlers started together over one sqlite
// database: the sequential await points line up, so both prechecks complete
// before either INSERT, which is the overlap the specimen describes. Killing
// mutations: drop `extraWhere` from the comment INSERT and two rows land;
// drop the re-read after a null write and the loser throws 429.
//
// Run: npm test
